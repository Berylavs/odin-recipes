    <p>
        Toaster quesadillas are all the rage right
         now and are simple to make once you 
         get the hang of it. The key is to make
          sure not to add too much to them.

   <p>
    They need to be as flat as possible 
          so that they do not get stuck but move 
        freely in and out of the toaster slots.
