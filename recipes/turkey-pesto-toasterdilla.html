    <h2>Turkey-Pesto Toasterdilla</h2>
    <p>
        Toaster quesadillas are all the rage right
         now and are simple to make once you 
         get the hang of it. The key is to make
          sure not to add too much to them.
   </p>
   <p>
    They need to be as flat as possible 
          so that they do not get stuck but move 
        freely in and out of the toaster slots.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 (10 inch) flour tortillas</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons prepared pesto</li>
            <li>1 stick mozzarella string cheese</li>
            <li>2 slices deli smoked turkey breast</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Lay tortillas on a clean work surface. 
                    Spread 1 tablespoon of pesto over each 
                    tortilla, leaving a small space around 
                    the entire edge. Peel the cheese back 
                    in thin layers and divide between the 
                    two tortillas in a single layer. 
                    Place 1 slice of turkey over the cheese on each tortilla.  </li>
                <li>Fold each tortilla in half, creating a 
                    half moon shape. Press down to flatten. 
                    Take the right half and fold it over
                     to the middle. Take the left half
                      and fold it over to the middle, 
                      creating an envelope shape.
                     Press down to flatten again.</li>
                    <li>Place quesadillas in the slots of the
                         toaster. Set toaster to medium heat
                          and toast for one cycle, about 3
                           minutes. Carefully remove quesadillas
                         and flip them around. 
                        Toast for 2 minutes more.</li>
                
                </ol>
